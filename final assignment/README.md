# Things to do

- Find literature or some other form of reference to define uncertainties

## Things to check

- Does it make sense to build the Dikes up at a later time step?
- Probably not

## Starting with Scenario discovery

- Visualization of initial values of different dike rings in comparison?

- What uncertainties lead to what unfavorable outcomes
