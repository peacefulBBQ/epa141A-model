This README complements the report of our group and provides additonal
information on the methodology and how we created the figures used in the
report.

This repository is built on top of the model provided as part of the course. The
additional added code and analysis is divided along the lines of the different
used analysis methods used in the report.

## Requirements for working with this repository

If you have used specific packages or have a weird setup which might make it
hard for others to run: mention it here or change them yourself

## Policy problem

Use Jupyter Notebook named "Problem Formulation varying policies" to visualize costs accross various policies.

## Global Sensitivity Analysis

Where are the relevant scripts?
Where are results saved?
Where can the figures be found which are used in the report?

1. Correlation matrices in the uncertainty space and policy space
  Use Jupyter Notebook named "Problem Formulation sensitivity".

3. Sobol indices
   Use Jupyter Notebook named "Problem Formulation sobol".
